--There are no NULL

--Analysis 

-- 1. What are the variables? 

SELECT * 
FROM "WHC"
LIMIT 1

--Country â€” the country 
--Happiness
--GDP - gross domestic product
--family - family score
--health
--freedom
--generosity
--government 
--dystopia
--continent 
--social_supp
--cpi 

-- 2. Can we group the data? Primary grouping is by continent > country 
--Can also group by year 

SELECT DISTINCT continent 
FROM "WHC"

Australia, Africa, Asia, South America, North America, Europe

SELECT * 
FROM "WHC"
WHERE year = 2015 

-- Repeat for 2016-2020

-- 3. What are the variables' correlation to happiness regardless of group?
